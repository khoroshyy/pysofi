pysofi - SOFI 2.0 Analysis in Python
=======================================================================

**Pysofi** is an open-source python pacakge for the super-solution image processing method `SOFI <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super-resolution_optical_fluctuation_imaging>`__. Pysofi supports tiff files with image stacks. Data can be acquired from cameras like EMCCD or sCMOS, or `simulations <https://github.com/xiyuyi/RealisticSimulator_3D>`__.

We provide well-tested implementaions of `SOFI2.0 <https://github.com/xiyuyi/SOFI2.0>`__ on live-cell imaging data in Jupyter notebook, as well as demos and examples on each step of the processing.
